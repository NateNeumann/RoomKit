# The Project:

This project is focussed on creating an Android app that will allow for a user to walk through a building and access information about its rooms. This will be implemented as a tour of Sudikoff. The app's main functionality will be automatic detection of rooms using local bluetooth beacon signals, a building map with the estimation of the room visualized, and room by room information. To acheive the information on rooms we will use Firebase so the data on rooms can be updated without updating the app. We will gather all the bluetooth data, and an online API called RoomKit to handle the neural-network learning required to classify that data into a room.
